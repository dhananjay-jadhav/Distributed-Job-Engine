# Test Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive testing implementation for the Distributed Job Engine project.

## Overview

As requested, this PR implements proper test cases with minimal mocking. All tests use real database instances and services instead of mocked data, ensuring tests are realistic and catch real-world issues.

## What Was Changed

### 1. GitHub CI/CD Configuration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- Uses `docker-compose` to start all services (PostgreSQL and any future dependencies)
- Wait step ensures PostgreSQL is ready before tests run
- Added database migration step before running tests
- Set DATABASE_URL environment variable for test execution
- Automatic cleanup with `docker-compose down`
- Future-proof: any new services added to `docker-compose.yaml` automatically available in CI

### 2. Integration Tests (Unit Tests with Real Database)

All unit tests have been enhanced to use a real PostgreSQL database:

#### Auth-DB Service (`libs/auth-db/src/lib/auth-db.service.spec.ts`)
- Tests database connection
- Tests raw query execution
- Proper cleanup with `$disconnect()`

#### Users Service (`libs/users/src/lib/users.service.spec.ts`)
- Tests user creation with password hashing
- Tests user retrieval by ID
- Tests user retrieval by email
- Tests error handling for non-existent users
- Proper cleanup of test data after each test

#### Auth Service (`libs/auth-service/src/lib/auth.service.spec.ts`)
- Tests login flow with valid credentials
- Tests login flow with invalid credentials
- Tests user verification
- Tests JWT token generation
- Tests cookie setting

#### Auth Resolver (`libs/auth-api/src/lib/auth.resolver.spec.ts`)
- Tests GraphQL login mutation
- Creates real users for testing
- Tests authentication flow

#### Auth Controller (`libs/auth-api/src/lib/auth.controller.spec.ts`)
- Tests gRPC authentication endpoint
- Tests user lookup by JWT payload

#### Users Resolver (`libs/users-api/src/lib/users.resolver.spec.ts`)
- Tests user creation mutation
- Tests user query by ID
- Tests authentication guard behavior

#### Jobs Service (`libs/jobs-service/src/lib/jobs.service.spec.ts`)
- Tests job discovery and registration
- Tests job filtering by name
- Tests job execution
- Tests error handling for non-existent jobs

#### Jobs Resolver (`libs/jobs-api/src/lib/jobs.resolver.spec.ts`)
- Tests jobs query
- Tests job filtering
- Tests job execution mutation
- Tests error handling

### 3. E2E Tests

Complete end-to-end tests have been implemented for both services:

#### Auth Service E2E (`apps/auth-e2e/src/auth/auth.spec.ts`)
- Tests user creation via GraphQL
- Tests user login
- Tests authentication cookies
- Tests authenticated queries
- Tests authorization errors

#### Jobs Service E2E (`apps/jobs-e2e/src/jobs/jobs.spec.ts`)
- Tests job listing
- Tests job filtering
- Tests job execution
- Tests authentication requirements
- Tests error handling

### 4. Documentation

#### TESTING.md

- Prerequisites and setup instructions
- How to run different types of tests
- How to run E2E tests with running services
- GitHub CI/CD explanation
- Test philosophy and best practices
- How to write new tests
- Troubleshooting guide

#### README.md Updates

## Test Coverage

### Total Test Cases: 43+

#### Unit/Integration Tests:
- ✅ auth-db: 3 tests
- ✅ users: 6 tests
- ✅ auth-service: 6 tests
- ✅ auth-api (resolver): 2 tests
- ✅ auth-api (controller): 3 tests
- ✅ users-api: 4 tests
- ✅ jobs-service: 6 tests
- ✅ jobs-api: 5 tests
- ✅ common-utils: 1 test

#### E2E Tests:
- ✅ auth-e2e: 6 test scenarios
- ✅ jobs-e2e: 6 test scenarios

## Key Features

### 1. Minimal Mocking
- Uses real PostgreSQL database
- Uses real Prisma client
- Uses real NestJS modules
- Only mocks external HTTP boundaries (Express Request/Response)

### 2. Proper Cleanup
- All tests clean up their data using `afterAll` or inline cleanup
- Unique identifiers (timestamps) prevent test conflicts
- Proper database disconnection

### 3. Real-World Scenarios
- Tests actual user creation with bcrypt hashing
- Tests actual JWT token generation
- Tests actual GraphQL queries and mutations
- Tests actual database transactions

### 4. GitHub CI Integration
- Automatic PostgreSQL setup
- Automatic migration execution
- Runs all tests on every PR/push
- No manual setup required

## How to Run Tests Locally

### 1. Quick Start
```bash
# Start database
docker compose up -d

# Wait for database to be ready (5 seconds)
sleep 5

# Run migrations
yarn nx migrate-prisma auth-db

# Run all tests
yarn nx run-many -t test
```

### 2. Individual Test Suites
```bash
yarn nx test auth-db
yarn nx test users
yarn nx test auth-service
yarn nx test jobs-service
```

### 3. E2E Tests
See TESTING.md for detailed instructions on running E2E tests with services.

## Benefits

1. **Higher Confidence**: Tests use real database, catching actual issues
2. **Less Maintenance**: No need to update mocks when implementation changes
3. **Realistic**: Tests reflect actual production behavior
4. **Better Coverage**: Integration points are tested, not just isolated units
5. **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions automatically runs all tests with database

## Technical Details

- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Docker Compose
- **ORM**: Prisma with real client
- **Test Framework**: Jest
- **Test Runner**: Nx
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with service containers

## Next Steps

The testing infrastructure is now in place. Future tests should follow the same pattern:
1. Use real database connections
2. Clean up test data
3. Use unique identifiers
4. Test realistic scenarios
5. Avoid mocking unless absolutely necessary

## Notes

- E2E tests require running services (auth and jobs)
- All unit/integration tests can run with just the database
- Tests are isolated and can run in parallel
- GitHub CI runs all tests automatically
